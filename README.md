# Stock Price Prediction using HMM, LSTM, and RNN

This repository contains an implementation of stock price prediction models using Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The models are applied to the NIFTY 50 index for time-series forecasting and performance comparison.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles stock price data with necessary transformations.
- **Multiple Models**:
  - **HMM** for pattern recognition in stock movements.
  - **LSTM** for capturing long-term dependencies.
  - **RNN** for sequential forecasting.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Absolute Percentage Error (APE)
  - Average Absolute Error (AAE)
  - Average Relative Percentage Error (ARPE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Model efficiency and accuracy scores
